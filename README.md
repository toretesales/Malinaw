An image converting software using ImageMagick and Victorvde's Jpeg2Png.
Originally a WinUI 3 port of KlaroWF, has later evolved to become a much wider image
converting application to convert to other popular image formats such as:

- JPEG (Jpeg to Png conversions can use Jpeg2Png for decoding)
- PNG
- TIFF
- WEBP
- ICO
- GIF(Static only)
- PDF (Because ImageMagick can do that apparently.)

This software is more of a case study in building UIs with XAML and WinUI 3, I would not
recommend using this software in a production scenario.
