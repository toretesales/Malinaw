# Malinaw

![Malinaw](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db4fba9-58ce-4bd2-934f-f4e2d35767a3)

A barebones image converting software using ImageMagick (through Magick.NET) and Victorvde's Jpeg2Png.
Originally a WinUI 3 port of KlaroWF, has later evolved to become a much wider image
converting application to convert to other popular image formats such as:

- JPEG (Jpeg to Png conversions can use Jpeg2Png for decoding)
- PNG
- TIFF
- WEBP
- ICO
- GIF (Static only)
- PDF (Because ImageMagick can do that apparently.)

This software is more of a case study in building UIs with XAML and WinUI 3, I will never
endorse the recommendation in using this software in a production scenario, please don't.

# Notice
DO NOT RUN THIS APPLICATION WITHOUT IT BEING FROM IT'S ORIGIN FOLDER, THE MALINAW FOLDER CONTAINS
DEPENDENCIES AND PROGRAM FILES THAT MALINAW RELIES ON, INCLUDING Jpeg2png.exe FOR REMOVING COMPRESSION
ARTIFACTING!!!!

# Features

Converts images from the afforementioned supported formats but forces you put them in a
specified folder.

Again, this application has some bugs here and there and I therefore DO NOT recommend using
Malinaw in a production environment, and I would recommend using something else that is more
robust instead.
